Please note that this project is still in development, and the design is not yet fully finalized.

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can click on the avatar icon and register by clicking the "Sign Up" button. If they don't confirm their email, they will receive an error when logging in.

- **Email Confirmation**: Users who confirm their email via the confirmation link will be able to log in successfully. I am aware of an issue where an error may be displayed after clicking the confirmation link; however, the verification process will still occur.

- **User Authentication**: Registered users can log in using their credentials.

- **Redux Persist**: User states are persistently stored, ensuring they are retained even when the page is refreshed or the browser is closed and reopened.

- **Photo Upload Feature**: The photo upload feature works when the application is installed locally.

- **Search Movies**: Users can search for movies using the search bar. They can type the movie title or keywords to find movies of interest.

- **Like Movies**: To like a movie, users must be logged in. Liking movies is an exclusive feature available to registered users.

- **Dark and Light Mode**
